== My Wines

My Wines was a wine database and application I built to manage my knowledge and tastings of different wines. I wanted a more structured data format than was offered by other applications, such as tasting notes along flavor profiles and rankings for various taste metrics (e.g. acidity, body, intensity).

It was eventually folded into [Pensieve](http://pensiev.com/).
